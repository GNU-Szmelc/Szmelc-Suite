# Szmelc.INC

Welcome to Szmelc.INC, an open-source Linux development crew dedicated to providing the world with free, ad-free, and bloat-free software for free! We love GNU and strive to create high-quality software that adheres to the principles of free software.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create software that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. We believe that software should be a tool that helps people, not a product that they must pay for. Our goal is to create a community of developers and users who share our passion for free software and who are committed to making the world a better place.

## Our Projects

At Szmelc.INC, we have a wide range of projects that we are working on, including:

- **Szmelc Commander 64**: An all-in-one package to manage and run Szmelc originals.
- **AntiSzmelc OS**: A fork of MX/Debian 11 OS with scripts to ensure maximum privacy and security.
- **Git-NForce**: A Git 2 Bash synchronizer that makes it easy to manage your code across multiple platforms.

And many many more!

We are always working on new projects and ideas, so be sure to check our website and GitHub page for updates!
